# CSCE629_Project_Network_Optimization
In this course project, i implemented a network routing protocol by Dijkstra’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm.
I test those two algorithm based on two differnet Graph.
One is a graph that every vertex has degree exactly 6, the other is a graph that each vertex has edges going to about 20% of the other vertices.
I also implemented Heap data structure and applied it to Dijkstra’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm
